# Photodetachment-in-Electric-field
photodet_green.for computes the quantum and semiclassical Green's function (in 3D) for an electron moving under a constant 
electric field. All subroutines are included in the main code.

statcaustic.for runs and store the data of an ensemble of classical trajectories. It creates a single file for each trajectory
and computes the caustic surface

caustic.plt is a gnuplot file that reads many files containing the trajectory data and plot them in order to visualize the caustic.
